# About

I'm a Graduate student at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) (USC) majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with specialization in Data Science. My research interest lies in application of Computer Vision in Autonomous Driving. I'm working as Computer Vision Summer Intern at [Frenzy Labs](https://frenzy.ai/) and as a Graduate Researcher at [USC Cyber-Physical Systems - VIDA](https://cps-vida.github.io/) group. 

I'm currently working on projects involving, 

- RESTful request dispatching using Flask framework to integrate object detection and classification network. 
- Semantic Segmentation on Berkeley Deep Drive Dataset using DeepLabv3+ segmentation algorithm. 
- Incorporate Signal Temporal (STL) monitoring, and vision based Timed Quality Temporal (TQTL) monitoringalgorithms for ROS to spot perception robustness. 

Before this, I received my B.S. in Instrumentation and Control Engineering at the Institute of Technology, Nirma University in 2015 and was working with Reliance Industries Ltd. till 2018 as Technical Manager. 


# Experience 

### 1. Computer Vision Intern (Frenzy Labs, Inc.)

Member of Machine Learning team focusing on optimzing the state-of-the-art backbone HCNN network to falicitate better predicitions, thus providing the user an inexplicable apparel experience. 

Responsibilites include, 
- Optimize the state-of-the-art backbone H-CNN and R-CNN network for apparel localization and classification from an image, smart labeling, and product search from photograph and content. 
- Develop a RESTful request dispatching using Flask framework to integrate object detection and classification network to boost detection performance and reducing search time to seconds. 


### 2. Graduate Researcher (USC CPS - VIDA group) 

I'm working with Prof. Jyotirmoy Deshmukh on developing monitoring algorithms for data streams that are generated by perception algorithms to be tested in a F1-10th autonomous vehicle. 

- Built the F1-10th autonomous vehicle for outdoor envirnment capable of localizing in a specific environment.
